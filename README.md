TNWF or Global Thermonuclear War is a ruby project that I started in to keep all my class lessons of ruby inside my head.
The best way of learning something is to get "shit deep" in it and then figure your way out.

Global Thermonuclear War is a Nuclear war simulation for NORAD from the movie "Wargames" most likey developed by
Professor Falkner. The movie is centered around a young hack dialer that hacks in to NORADs simulation computer and starts
panic by activating a nuclear war sim on a global scale.

This program is written in ruby and may not be a exact replica of the war sim.
This program's licensing and copyright falls under the Pirate's Code(Take it all, And give nothing back) so enjoy.
If you wish to commit something to this bit of fun, Thanks for the thought. If I don't get to your commit in a timely manner
its not because I don't like the your face looks. Its most likey because I haven't been on Github since your commit so play it cool.
I'll get to it eventually.
